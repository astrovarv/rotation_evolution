# rotation_evolution

This project is an attempt to build an analytical model of angular momentum evolution in low-mass M-dwarf stars. 

Using Mestel's derivations for the angular momentum transport by stellar wind (1968), this model builds on the previous works by [Mohanty and Reiners (2012)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/746/1/43/meta). For example, the dipolar field is incorporated into the model.

[Evolution.py](https://github.com/astrovarv/rotation_evolution/blob/main/Evolution.py) contains the main code, [Demo.py](https://github.com/astrovarv/rotation_evolution/blob/main/Demo.ipynb) shows some visualisations.

(This is a work in progress and is being updated constantly)
