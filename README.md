# rotation_evolution

This project is an attempt to build an analytical model of angular momentum evolution in low-mass M-dwarf stars. 

Using Mestel's derivations for the angular momentum transport by stellar wind (1968), this model builds on the previous works by Mohanty and Reiners (2012). For example, the dipolar field is incorporated into the model.

This is a work in progress being updated constantly :)
